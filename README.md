# R-nycflights13-UA
The analysis will attempt to identify the core cause of departure delays for United Airlines aircraft
departing from New York City in 2013. The goal is to decrease flight delay time by determining
what variables are causing the delays.This will enable United Airlines customers to improve those
aspects, hence increasing customer happiness and flying effectively. The study focuses on environmental
characteristics such as the time of day, year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation and
visibility.

Our analysis will be carried out by leveraging the nycflights13 dataset. This dataset contains
the departure timings for all flights departing from New York Cityâ€™s three airports - La Guardia
(LGA), John F. Kennedy (JFK), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in 2013. For
the scope of this project, we will be focusing on the data related to United Airlines.
